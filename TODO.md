# TODO 


* [ ] Handle multiple EMG samples per frame
  * right now only the last sample in frame is used
* [ ] Make choice of channel configurable
* [ ] Figure out the timing of the obstacles
  * variable vs constant
* [ ] Make sure only one obstacle is displayed at the same place
* [ ] Obtain the proper EMG data from OpenBCI
  * right now it's just PhysioNet data, that does not have the correct format
* [ ] Try the game live with OpenBCI
